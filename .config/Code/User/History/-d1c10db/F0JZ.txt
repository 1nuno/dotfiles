MVP 6 - Volumes to the mariadb container
        and standarize so it works in any
        pc
------------------------------------


MariaDB

    CONTAINER:

        *2* Connect to the "mariadb-network" network;
        - The DB "sic" is created automatically when the container is created;
        - Make use of a custom Dockerfile to setup the MariaDB environment.
        *6* Add volumes




PHPMYADMIN

    CONTAINER:

        *2* Connect to the "mariadb-network" network;
        - Make use of a custom Dockerfile to setup the PHPMYADMIN environment.




RabbitMQ

    CONTAINER:

        *2* Connect to the "rabbitmq-network" network;
        - Make use of a custom Dockerfile to setup the RabbitMQ environment:

            - Turn on the MQTT plugin.




TOKEN GENERATOR (app_pub.py)

    SCRIPT:

        - Connect to the MQTT broker;
        *5* Publish to the /sic/log the following string: "Starting tokens generation!"
        *4* Generate a real hexadecimal tokens using the libray secrets but this time with some
        enviromental variables to customize the behaviour (look at the CONTAINER section for better clarification);
        - Publish the generated tokens to the channel /sic/tokens.
        *5* Once all the tokens are published, publish to /sic/log the following string:
            "Finishing the tokens generation!"

    CONTAINER:

        *2* Connect to the "rabbitmq-network" network;
        - Make use of a custom Dockerfile to setup the python (development) environment:

            - paho MQTT (library);
            *3* secrets (library);
            *4* make use of the enviromental variables to customize the behaviour:

                NUMTOKENS - Is the number of tokens that will be sent to the broker;
                INTERVAL - Is the time frequency (in seconds) in which the tokens will be sent to
                           the broker;
                LENGTHTOKEN - Is the length (number of characters) that every single token will
                              have;






TOKEN PROCESSING (app_sub.py)

    SCRIPT:

    - Connect to the MQTT broker;
    *5* Subscribe to the MQTT channel /sic/# (this means subscribe to all the child channels of
      /sic, because now we will have two channels: /sic/tokens and /sic/log);
    - Connect to the MariaDB, more specifically to a DB called "sic";
    - Insert the data received from the MQTT channel into the the sic table;

    CONTAINER:

        *2* Connect to the "rabbitmq-network" AND "mariadb-network" networks;
        - Make use of a custom Dockerfile to setup the python (development) environment:

            - mysql connector (library);
            - paho MQTT (library);
