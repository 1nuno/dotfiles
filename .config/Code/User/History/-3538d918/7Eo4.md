# SIC-23-24-1
This repo contains the code for the first assigment of my uni subject, SIC - Sistemas e Infraestruturas de Comunicação.

When running the step-by-step.sh file make sure to uncomment the line that has a time.sleep() in both the app-sub.py and app-pub.py because the rabbitmq server might not be ready when the apps try to access it.
