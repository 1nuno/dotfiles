TOKEN GENERATOR (app_pub.py)

    SCRIPT:

TOKEN PROCESSING (app_sub.py)

    SCRIPT:

    - Connect to the MQTT broker;
    - Subscribe to the MQTT channel /sic/tokens;
    - Connect to the MariaDB, more specifically to a DB called "sic";
    - Insert the data received from the MQTT channel into the the sic table;

    CONTAINER:

        * Connect to the Global network;
        - Make use of a custom Dockerfile to setup the python (development) environment:

            - mysql connector (library);
